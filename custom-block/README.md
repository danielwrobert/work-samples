# Custom Block

This is an example of a custom block written in React (no ACF), including block.json and edit.js.

Here I chose a simple "Related Posts" block that I put together for a client. It is a simple block and it is not currently used in the site yet (they are still in the process adding more content before this block is used), but it's a good example of how I would create a custom block in Gutenberg.

## Additional Examples

Most of my work and involvement with custom blocks over the past few years has been done in the [WooCommerce Blocks](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/) and [WooCommerce](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/) repositories.

Below is a PR that I authored while working on the Mini Cart block. Note that I did not author the block from the start, but it fell under my team's purview and I was able to contribute to it during one of our Sprints.
